Hippo CMS Docker Deployments
=============================
Deploy Hippo CMS as containers using docker compose, docker swarm and kubernetes. I have been working with Hippo CMS since early 2015. Hippo CMS is by far one of the finest Java based Open Source Content Management system out there. Ever since I have learned about Docker, I have been experimenting the idea of deploying Hippo CMS on Docker. After stalling and failing for years, I finally have receipe for successfully deploying Hippo CMS as a Dockerized Container using Docker Compose, Docker Swarm and Kubernetes (using OpenShift and Rancher). 

* [Docker Compose](https://github.com/maheshacharya/hippo-docker-deployments/blob/master/docker-compose/README.md)

TBD (Stay Tuned)
* [Docker Swarm]
* [Kubernetes]
 * [OpenShift]
 * [Rancher]
